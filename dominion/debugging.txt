The error that I decided to work one
was won I found in foulgerd dominion.c code.
When debugging the initializeGame code I noticed 
that the players hand was never getting cards. So
I ran my Unittest.c test on mt initializeGame code
and found that it too was giving me the same error. 
I was able to discover this error by using the first rule
in Agans' Debugging Rules "Understand the System".

Agans' Debugging Rule #1 "Understaing the System" tells us 
that debugging a system you dont uderstant is point less and 
that subject knowledge matters and that you need to understand
the problem. So by reading the rules of dominion and how to set
up the game. I was able to see that the number of cards in the 
players begining hand was not correct. 

This lead me to Agans' Debugging Rule #2 "Make it fail." After
noticing the errror I wrote test that would fail if the number
of cards was not correct, then display the difference in the
hands. I found that some times the player would get no cards 
and other times the player gould get 4 cards but those cards 
where not valid cardnumbers. 

After making a failing test, Agans' Debugging Rule #3 
"Quit Thinking and Look" and sure enought. Inside the the 
initializeGame funciton I found commented code for the initialization
of the player hand. If you noticed in Code Snippit 1 you will see that
lines 6 - 10 had been commented out.

Code Snippit 1:
Line 1:  //draw player hands
Line 2:     for (i = 0; i < numPlayers; i++) {
Line 3:         //initialize hand size to zero
Line 4:         state->handCount[i] = 0;
Line 5:         state->discardCount[i] = 0;
Line 6:         //draw 5 cards
Line 7:         // for (j = 0; j < 5; j++)
Line 8:         //  {
Line 9:         //    drawCard(i, state);
Line 10:        //  }
Line 11:     }

After uncommenting the lines 6 - 10 all the players hand counts were
fixed except for player 1 whos hand count was set to five but his deck count
was 0. So this ment that he was still was drawing to many cards in the game 
initialization. Looking at the bottom the initializeGame method player one
get his game initialize but also draws 5 more cards. So to prevent fix the 
error I commented out line 1 - 5 in the method inorder to prevent the first
play from drawing more then 5 cards when the game is initialized.

Line 1: state->handCount[state->whoseTurn] = 0;
Line 2:     //Moved draw cards to here, only drawing at the start of a turn
Line 3:    for (it = 0; it < 5; it++) {
Line 4:       drawCard(state->whoseTurn, state);
Line 5:    }

When working to fix this bug I use Agans' Degubbing Rule #5 "Change One Thing at a
Time" to make sure that I monerterd how my changes effect on the bug that I was working
on. By using this rule I make sure that code that I emplimented did not introduced new bugs.
