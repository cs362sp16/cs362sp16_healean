Mutaution Testing Results
Total Mutantions: 227
Passed Mutantions: 171
Failed Mutantions: 56


My results where not what I was expecting. I figured
that I would have caught more mutants then I actually did.
This could be do to a number of reason but it deffenly says
that my test suit is not that good.

Something that I noticed is that it takes a log time to run
a mutant test. Also quite abut of time to set up. I had to shorten
my run time becase it was taking 30 plus minutes to execute.
When doing mutant testing I feel that you also introduce some
error when building the tester. The first time that I ran my script
I was not compiling the right dominion.o file andit said that I had not mutants.
