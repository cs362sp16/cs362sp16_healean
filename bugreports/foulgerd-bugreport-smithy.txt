Bug Report 1 (Smithy)

For the first bug I looked for was in smithy. Smithy is suppost 
to add three cards to the hand the and then discard one card increasing
the hand count by 2. In your case, smithy's card effect only gives the
user a single card but that card is then discarded so the players hand
size in never increased.

The way to produce this bug is to play a smith card and check the game state 
hand count for that player. If the hand count has not been inceased by two then
the error has accured. This can be triggered by calling cardEffect with a smithy
card value.

The priority and severity of this error would be high proprity and low severity.
Becase each user will have the same effect the severity of the problem is low
since each user will have the same out come and no one is gain an advantage. 
The priority is high becase it is a core functionaly of the game and smith is 
played a lot so it will need to be taken care of.
