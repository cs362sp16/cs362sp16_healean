Bug Report (InitializeGame)

This bug is with int he initializeGame funciton. When 
the game is initialize each player is to get 5 cards.
After examining the game state I have found that 
no cards are givng to the player.

The way to produce this error is to just initialize the game
with any aound of players. You will find that no user will be 
givig cards to there hand.

The priority and severity of this bug it hight priority and 
high severity. I would say the severity is high becase with out
cards the game cannot be played this would result in a stalled
session of the game. Aslo the priority is hight becase it is of
the main funciton of the game and that pice of code runs everytime
again is being played.
