Bug Report 2 (Village)

An error was found the card effect village. I notice that
the number of action taken was not correct after the card
was played. When village is playted the number of action 
is to inceassed by 2. In your coud the number of action 
is increaded by 3.

The way to produce this errer is to call cardEffect with
villiage as the speficied card to be played. You will notice 
that the nimber of action taken has been inceashed by 2. 

The priority and severity would be high priority and low severity.
Since the effect is the same for everyone who plays a village and
doesnt give anyone an avantage the severity would be low. But sicne 
it is a main functioning card that is played the does need tobe fixed
so it give it a high priority.
